# Motives and Background
One day... I made an online shop that have so many item on the catalogue... and I am lazy everytime someone ordered so many item (more than 3 item) and I manually made invoice on excel. It cost me soooo much time too look at the order list and the price list, so the customer need to wait a minute or more just to wait for the invoice. So i decide to make this automatic invoice bot, so the customer won't wait much longer time. 

# Project Duration
I made this bot within 7 days because i need to learn javascript & twitter API's first. I will make ver 2 from this bot where the calculation will be written on image (it's cuter and unique which will be an attractiveness value of my online shop)
